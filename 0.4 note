Hugh,

Looks to me like the output is correct. However I suspect your Mac would benefit from a UTF-8 signature character (U+FEFF, also known as Byte Order Mark or BOM) at the start of the output, so I've added a -b option to generate that.

So try the attached replacement script (which should have correct line-endings for Mac, and it has the she-bang at the start -- you'll need to chmod +x it, of course) -- and just add -b to your command-line options.

Bob
